                <h2>What I do</h2>
                <p>I’m a Designer turned Full Stack Developer with a focus on building clear, confident brands and modern digital experiences. My background in graphic design gives me a strong foundation in visual communication, while my development work brings structure, logic, and performance to everything I make.</p>

                <h2>How I work</h2>
                <p>I care about simplicity, intention, and craft. My process is grounded in understanding the problem first — then designing or coding solutions that feel clean, scalable, and user-friendly. Whether it’s a logo, a website, or an app, I build with equal attention to aesthetics and functionality.</p>

                <h2>Why clients hire you</h2>
                <p>Clients work with me because they want someone who understands design thinking and development. Someone who can take an idea from concept to execution without losing clarity or quality along the way. My goal is always the same: help people make things that stand out and work beautifully.</p>
